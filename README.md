# Prompt Drift

**Prompt Drift** is an interactive Streamlit app that explores how meaning evolves between text and images over multiple rounds of transformations.

Starting with either a text prompt or an image, the app alternates between generating an image from text and describing that image using a multimodal language model. The result is a fascinating "drift" in content between AI models.
